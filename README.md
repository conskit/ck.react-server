# ck.react-server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/conskit/ck.react-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/conskit/ck.react-server) [![Dependencies Status](https://jarkeeper.com/conskit/ck.react-server/status.svg)](https://jarkeeper.com/conskit/ck.react-server) [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/ck.react-server.svg)](https://clojars.org/ck.react-server)

A nashorn-based react serverside rendering module for [conskit](https://github.com/conskit/conskit)

## Installation

Add the dependency in the clojars badge above in your `project.clj`.

## Requires
- Java 8 or above (for nashorn)

## Usage
Add the following to your `bootstrap.cfg`:

```
ck.react-server/renderer
```

Add the following to your `config.conf`

```properties
react-server: {
  pool-size: 3 # number of rendering functions available at runtime
  js-path: "public/js/compiled/app.js" # clojurescript output file
  namespace: "myapp.core" # clojurescript namespace  
  method: "render_to_string" # method that executes react's renderToString
  dev-mode: yes # dev-mode will not render using nashorn and will allow rendering on the client
}
```

Add the dependency, binding and interceptor in your serivice

```clojure
(ns myapp
  (:require [ck.react-server :as ckrs]))

(defservice
  my-service
  [[:ActionRegistry register-bindings! register-interceptors!]
   [:CKReactServer get-render-fn]]
  (init [this context]
    ...
    (register-bindings {:get-render-fn get-render-fn}))
    (register-interceptors [ckrs/react-server-page])
  ...)
```

Create a template function like the following

```clojure
;; Hiccup is used here but this could be any templating tool that returns HTML as a string
(defn app-template
  [rendered-html meta state]
  (hiccup/html5
    [:head
      [:meta {:name "keywords" :content (:keywords meta)}]
      [:title (:title meta)]]
    [:body
     [:div#app rendered-html]
     [:script#app-state {:type "application/edn"} app-state]
     [:script "myapp.core.init()"]]))
```

Annotate the actions with `:react-server-page` and return the status along with any data needed for the page

```clojure
(action
  ^{:react-server-page {:title "My Awesome App"
                        :keywords "my, awesome, app, wow"
                        :template-fn app-template}
  awesome-page
  [req]
  ;; awesome logic
  [:ck.react-server/ok {:page :data}])
```

The status can be an explicit code e.g. `[501 {:page :data}]` or one of 

```clojure
:ck.react-server/ok ;; 200
:ck.react-server/internal-error ;;500
:ck.react-server/unauthorized ;; 401
:ck.react-server/redirect ;;302
:ck.react-server/not-found ;; 404
```

You can also return additional response data (such as cookies or session data) by specifying a third entry in the returned vector

```clojure
(action
  ^{:react-server-page {:title "My Awesome App"
                        :keywords "my, awesome, app, wow"
                        :template-fn app-template}
  awesome-page
  [req]
  ;; awesome logic
  [:ck.react-server/ok {:page :data} {:cookies {"secret-cookie" {:value "emosewa"}}}])
```

## Documentation

### Service

Key: `:CKReactServer`

|Method | Description|
|----|---|
|`get-render-fn` | Returns a rendering function from the pool|

The render function returned from the above has the following expects to be provided with:

- `template-fn` - a function that returns an HTML string for the page. It should accept three parameters:
  - `rendered-html` - This is the html that was rendered by the nashorn engine. Typically you'll want to place this within your mount point in the html string
  - `metadata` - This is any metadata such as title, seo keywords and anything else that you know will be specific to each page
  - `page-state` - same as the `state` param below
- `state` - This value represents the page state that can be used in the reactJS app to render specific components. It typically looks like this: `[:myapp/awesome-page {:meta {:title "Awesome Page"} :data {:page :data}}]`. where `:meta` is the same data as the above parameter and `:data` is whatever was returned as response data 

### Interceptor

The interceptor provided: `ck.react-server/react-server-page` uses the render function described above, when it wraps actions, to return a [ring response](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Creating-responses) with the page rendered by nashorn.

The annotation for actions is `:react-server-page` and the only mandatory value is the `:template-fn` described in the previous section. all other values are treated as metadata.

In cases where only the page state is needed, for instance when routing and rendering on the client side, you can send an ajax request with the header `X-State-Only` set to `"true"`
